Fundamental to any approach to securing and protecting OT systems is the complete and accurate identification of all OT assets and systems and how they connect and communicate across an organizationâ€™s networks.\
This data should be standardized. In the following the data models with its attributes and roles are explained. Furthermore, the mapping for the [DDDC-Plugin](https://github.com/DINA-community/DDDC-Netbox-plugin) for [NetBox](https://netboxlabs.com/docs/netbox/en/stable/) with [CSAF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/os/csaf-v2.0-os.html) is illustrated.
