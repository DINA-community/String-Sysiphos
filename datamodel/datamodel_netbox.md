This show how the data model is placed and the status of implementation.

## Fragen/TODO

Open questions:

- [NetBox model](https://netboxlabs.com/docs/netbox/en/stable/models/dcim/)

## TODOS

- a links to the fields and use # sign check
- sortieren nach device, device type und software
- update device type issue
- check hardware as core field?
- check communication partner value
